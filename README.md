# Eda1 (BANK_FRRAUD_DATA):
    This dataset provides a structured and comphrensive view of banking transactions, enabling the development of fraud detection models and financial risk analysis. With real-world transaction attributes such as device type, merchant category, and transaction amount, this data allows for:
    * Pattern Recognition: Identifying anomalies in customer transactions that indicate fraudulent activity.
    * Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful insights to improve fraud detection accuracy.
    *  Machine Learning Applications: Training supervised and unsupervised models to detect fraudulent transactions.
    Financial Risk Mitigation: Helping banks and financial institutions prevent losses due to fraud.
       BY leveraging this dataset, we can enhance a AI- powered transcation models, enhance real time _monitoring and stregthen bank-security frameworks. Banks can use it to identify suspicious activities, reduce false positives in fraud detection, and optimize risk management strategies.In real-world applications, such insights can help banks prevent financial losses, minimize operational risks, and enhance customer trust by ensuring secure transactions. This makes the dataset an essential resource for tackling modern financial fraud and advancing security innovations in the banking sector.

# Eda2 (Ischemic_stroke):
 This dataset provides a comprehensive record of ischemic stroke patient data, including demographics, hospital visit timelines, and various medical interventions. With 5,147 patient records, it captures critical timestamps such as admission, discharge, CT scan, and specialist visits.This helps in:
    * Predicting stroke outcomes based on patient history and treatment timelines.
    * Optimizing hospital workflows by analyzing emergency department efficiency.
    * Improving stroke management strategies, especially in ICU and neurology ward care.
    By leveraging this dataset, we can ehnance more facility in healthcare analytics,hosital resource planning.And many researchers and medical professionals can work towards enhancing stroke management, reducing delays in treatment, and improving patient survival rates.
